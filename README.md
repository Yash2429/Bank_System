# Bank_System

This is a bank system which is use to transfer money between two bank accounts.
It also allows us to create new users and keep a record of transactions that happened.
Technologies used here are HTML, CSS and JS for designing and NODE JS for backend development.
This project was made as a task for TSP's Grip Program.
